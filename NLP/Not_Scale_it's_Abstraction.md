## The nature of Abstraction: reusing programs and representations 

* Abstraction is the key of Generalization.
* Hypothesis : The complexity & variability of any domain is the result of the repetition, composition, transformation, indtantiation of a small number
  of "Kernels od structure"
* Abstraction : Past experiences for resusable kernels of strucutre. 
* Intelligence : High sensitivity to similarities and isomorohisms, ability to recast old patterns into a new context. (relate with universe)

**Abstraction**  
It is a spectrum from poitwise factoids to organize knowledge that works in many situations to generalizable models that work on any situation in a domain to the ability 
to produce new models to adapt to a new problem to the ability to producwe new models efficiently. 

**Central Question: Are LLM capable of abstraction? Can they reason?**
